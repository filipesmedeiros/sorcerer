Sorcerer uses the [MageTools](https://mage.tools?utm_source=sorcerer) color palette. These colors are inspired by cyberpunk art, video game magic, and vibrant dark themes like Monokai, Styrokai, and One Dark Pro.

Special care was given to the appearance of several languages which are popular in frontend development: JSX, HTML, CSS, JSON, and Markdown.

I'd love to expand Sorcerer beyond these languages. If you encounter any quirks or want to help out, I'd love for you to submit an issue or pull request at [github.com/markthomasmiller/sorcerer](https://github.com/markthomasmiller/sorcerer). This helps me stay organized and work to make the theme better for everyone.
